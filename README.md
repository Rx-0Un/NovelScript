The second target is to complete features of a visual novel reader, and the lecture of scripts(those of galgames) from external test files will be formed, and a framework will also be released so that normal user can easily build there own web galgames with NovelScript. This will be released as NovelScript, with a framework(May be called "NovelScript-UI").
